## General Information
This application project is designed to work like the popular ride-hailing app, Uber. It will allow users to request and schedule rides, track the location of their driver in real-time, and make payments through the app. The app will use geolocation services to match riders with nearby drivers, and will allow for multiple ride options, such as carpooling and luxury vehicles. It will also feature a rating system for drivers, and provide estimated wait and arrival times. Additionally, the application will have an admin panel for managing and monitoring the drivers and rides.
